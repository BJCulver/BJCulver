Hello, I am @BJCulver. I am a Master's of Science in Computational Science student at George Mason University focusing in data science. I am interested in database and data analytics roles.

On this page one can find my personal and academic projects. I am working on composing music using google's magenta platform and plan on personal forays into NLP and geospatial-focused projects.

Prior to my transition into data science, I was a classical trombonist. A musician must diligently work on their own practice and take creative approaches to their artistry. Following in that spirit, I hope this Git will document my personal developments in data science.
